# domain-sift

`domain-sift` is a Perl script that extracts unique domains from
at least one provided file and prints them to standard output. If
no file is provided, domain-sift reads from standard input instead.

One use of this utility is to extract domains from blocklists
that contain known malicious or otherwise undesirable domains,
and then format them in such a way that those domains can be
blocked by a DNS resolver.

## Installation

To install domain-sift, grab the most recent release and run the
following commands inside the source directory. Note that domain-sift
requires Perl 5.36 or later, since subroutine signatures are no
longer experimental in that release.

```
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
# make install
```

## Documentation

After installation, you can read the documentation with `perldoc`.
`man` often works as well.

```
$ perldoc Domain::Sift
$ perldoc Domain::Sift::Match
$ perldoc Domain::Sift::Manipulate
$ perldoc domain-sift
```

## domain-sift and unwind

Here's how to use `domain-sift` with
[`unwind(8)`](https://man.openbsd.org/unwind) on OpenBSD.

1. Extract domains from your blocklist source:

```
$ domain-sift /path/to/blocklist_source > blocklist
```

2. Then, modify your `unwind.conf` to include your new blocklist:

```
block list "/path/to/blocklist"
```

3. Restart `unwind`.

```
# rcctl restart unwind
```

## domain-sift and unbound

Here's how to use `domain-sift` with
[`unbound(8)`](https://man.openbsd.org/unbound) on OpenBSD.

1. Extract domains from your blocklist source:

```
$ domain-sift -f unbound /path/to/blocklist_source > blocklist
```

2. Move the blocklist to `/var/unbound/etc`.

```
# mv blocklist /var/unbound/etc/blocklist
```

3. Then, modify your `unbound.conf` to include your new blocklist:

```
include: "/var/unbound/etc/blocklist"
```

4. Restart `unbound`.

```
# rcctl restart unbound
```

## domain-sift and unbound (RPZ)

`domain-sift` also supports the Response Policy Zone (RPZ) format.
[RPZ is defined in this Internet
Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-vixie-dnsop-dns-rpz/).

By using RPZ, you can define DNS blocking policies in a standardized
way. A nice perk of using RPZ is the ability to block wildcarded
domains (`*.example.com` will also block `subdomain.example.com`,
`subdomain.subdomain.example.com`, and so on).

Here's how to use `domain-sift` with Unbound and RPZ on OpenBSD.

1. Extract domains from your blocklist source:

```
$ domain-sift -f rpz /path/to/blocklist_source > blocklist
```

2. Then, modify your `unbound.conf`:

```
rpz:
  name: rpz.home.arpa
  zonefile: /var/unbound/etc/rpz-block.zone
  #rpz-log: yes
  rpz-signal-nxdomain-ra: yes
```

NOTE: `rpz.home.arpa` is just an example. The name entry may be
different in your case. In a local access network (LAN) where Unbound
runs on the gateway/router, ensure that a `local-data` entry is
present somewhere so that the name you chose resolves. Something
like this should work:

```
local-data: "rpz.home.arpa. IN A x.x.x.x"
```

You'll need to replace `x.x.x.x` with the machine's actual IP
address.

3. Create `/var/unbound/etc/rpz-block.zone`:

```
$ORIGIN rpz.home.arpa.
$INCLUDE /var/unbound/etc/blocklist
```

4. Make sure that you move `blocklist` to the correct location.

```
# mv /path/to/blocklist /var/unbound/etc/blocklist
```

5. Restart Unbound.

```
# rcctl restart unbound
```
